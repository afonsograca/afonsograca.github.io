      <p>The communities that grow around certain topics and technologies are one of the best perks of being a software developer.<br>
Be it through blog posts, podcasts, meetups or conferences, content is surely available. One of my favourite ways of sharing one&rsquo;s thoughts and experiences is through talks/meetups, not only you get to learn, but also have the opportunity to talk directly with the people that went through those same things that you might be tackling.<br>
Yet, one of my biggest cruxes was that I never really thought I had anything interesting enough to share/add to what was already out there, but I knew I wanted to give back to my community and I also wanted to work on my public-speaking skills. So pushing the discouraging thoughts aside I started talking about what I was doing, first informally during lunch to a couple of colleagues, then eventually internally to the whole engineering team at my companies and finally, publicly at tech conferences/meetups.</p>
<p>Although I don&rsquo;t do it as much as I want to, I&rsquo;ve grown fond of talking about the topics I&rsquo;m passionate about. The biggest takeaways though are these: that there&rsquo;s always someone who appreciates your effort and you will learn/improve from having done so.</p>
