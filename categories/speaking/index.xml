      <description>The communities that grow around certain topics and technologies are one of the best perks of being a software developer.
Be it through blog posts, podcasts, meetups or conferences, content is surely available. One of my favourite ways of sharing one&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and experiences is through talks/meetups, not only you get to learn, but also have the opportunity to talk directly with the people that went through those same things that you might be tackling.</description>
