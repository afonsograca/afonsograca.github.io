      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a software developer since 2013. Starting out as a web developer, but quickly transitioned to iOS development as soon as the opportunity came along. Although Objective-C is something I still need to deal with from time to time, Swift has been my focus for some years now.
I&amp;rsquo;m a UX enthusiast. There is a sense of joy when you build something that works just as it&amp;rsquo;s expected, when you bring delight to your users.</description>
